# Washington State Hazard Lookup

A program I made as a final project for a programming class. 

Web scrapes to get the necessary data, however the scraped data needs to be converted to a shapefile in ArcPro to continue. 

Creates a geodataframe of the known hazards present at an input address, and prints a digestable description/explanation of the hazards at that location.
